1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,320
you ever find yourself needing a really

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,359
quick way to turn your phone to torch on

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,559
and off well enter action Notch a really

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,360
powerful application that can do just

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,759
that plus a bunch more the app actually

6
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:14,599
gives you up to five different gestures

7
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,199
that you can perform on your phone's

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,119
camera hole punch that you can then set

9
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,920
up to activate a variety of actions so

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,800
I've got a single touch set up to turn

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,400
on and off my phon torch I've got a

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,119
double touch setup to launch the camera

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,640
app I've got a long touch setup to open

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,640
Spotify F and then a swipe left and a

15
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,840
swipe right to skip to the previous and

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,000
next tracks respectively really cool

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,920
second up today is Zone launcher a neat

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,000
hidden App Launcher of sorts that works

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,200
within any application with the app set

20
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,000
up you simply swipe in from the right of

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,680
your screen and you'll instantly be

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,440
greeted with all of your favorite apps

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,840
and you can then release your finger

24
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,920
over whichever app you want to open and

25
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,960
there you go you can also add additional

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,199
pages of apps categorized however you

27
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,079
like and if you upgrade to the premium

28
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,879
version that will will then unlock a

29
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,280
huge amount of tweaks and customizations

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,600
as well following that is remon a fresh

31
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,720
off the press reminders application with

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,080
a super clean design to go with the

33
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,119
app's primary goal is to get rid of all

34
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,439
of the sometimes unnecessary clutter

35
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,799
that comes packed into sermon to do list

36
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:19,799
style applications these days and so

37
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,240
what you end up with in remine is a

38
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,880
really minimal and intuitive UI you just

39
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,040
tap this add reminder button select the

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,040
reminder type change the icon if you

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,360
like as well as the color if you're

42
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,720
feeling a bit fancy then you give your

43
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,799
reminder a name like empty bins for

44
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,439
example then you tap create reminder and

45
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,240
that's it you'll now be reminded at your

46
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,240
desired time now because the app is

47
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,240
relatively new it does have some Kinks

48
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,479
to iron out and the premium version is

49
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,920
far too expensive in my opinion but I

50
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,719
think it's got a lot of Promise a

51
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:52,079
fantastic UI with excellent animations

52
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,960
and it's already received a bunch of

53
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,159
pretty significant updates thus far so

54
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,840
absolutely worth trying out for

55
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,159
sure now speaking of amazing uis and

56
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,840
animations namida is a beautifully

57
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,759
designed music and video player

58
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,878
application that seriously stuned me

59
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,720
with just how nice its UI is I mean just

60
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,080
look at these animations as I open and

61
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,560
close this music play here and check out

62
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,080
how the album artwork dynamically pulses

63
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,200
in sync with the music it is

64
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,400
ridiculously fluid and cool and there's

65
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,040
a stack of other examples of these

66
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,360
beautiful animations throughout other

67
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,720
parts of the interface as well and then

68
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,120
on top of the music playing

69
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,319
functionality it also includes video

70
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,920
playing functionality but I'll let you

71
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,840
explore that feature on your own if you

72
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,920
like even without that feature the app

73
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,840
is still worth trying just simply

74
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,319
because of how nice the design is and

75
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,800
then while we're on the topic of Music

76
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,640
related apps CD romantic is a really

77
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,000
cool art with a super nostalgic design

78
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,519
that allows you to convert your favorite

79
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,920
music into vapor wave Style music and

80
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,720
before we even get to the functionality

81
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,480
I mean just have a look at the design

82
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,480
here this is like classic Windows 95

83
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,640
Style which brings back so many memories

84
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,879
to me but then aside from the design to

85
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,760
actually use the app's functionality you

86
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,680
just pick a track that you want to edit

87
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,680
and once selected you'll get a bunch of

88
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,720
these audio effects that will completely

89
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,560
change up its style and the effects

90
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,879
aren't like these super corny lowquality

91
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:18,239
effects either somehow they actually do

92
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,360
sound really cool if you're looking for

93
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,720
some trippy relaxing ambient style

94
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,040
versions of your favorite

95
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,120
tracks all right before we get to the

96
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,120
next application just wanted to take a

97
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,920
moment to talk about some amazing new

98
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,000
speakers that I recently got which are

99
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,879
actually from the sponsor of this video

100
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,280
kef now if you've heard of the brand kef

101
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,879
before then you'll probably be aware

102
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,480
that they make some of the world's most

103
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,920
premium and well-built speakers but

104
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,280
their latest offering the LSX 2 LTS

105
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,720
whilst they're still not what many would

106
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,040
consider outrageously cheap they are a

107
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,439
much more accessible set of speakers and

108
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,239
yet despite their more affordable price

109
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,840
tag they still utilize kef's impressive

110
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,280
uniq driver array technology which

111
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,159
places is the Twitter precisely at the

112
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,360
acoustic center of the base and

113
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,760
mid-range cone which allows the speakers

114
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,720
to disperse sound evenly throughout any

115
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,040
room therefore eliminating that singular

116
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,640
Sweet Spot issue that impacts most other

117
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,920
speakers on the market plus the sound

118
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,279
quality that they produce is on another

119
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,959
level I've actually been using them at

120
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,120
my editing desk for the past 2 months

121
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,680
and man they sound incredible here have

122
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,080
a

123
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,600
listen I know sometimes life can be

124
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,360
[Music]

125
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,800
and you feel like you're

126
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,320
just to learn more about them or to pick

127
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,840
up a pair for yourself use the first

128
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,479
link down in the description

129
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,160
below okay halfway down the list and a

130
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,360
long time ago I featured a weather app

131
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,440
on the channel called geometric weather

132
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,160
which I know for a fact was a lot of

133
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,039
users favorite weather app simply

134
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:57,560
because of how incredible the design was

135
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,720
unfortunately development on that app Di

136
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,440
a number of years back and it's no

137
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,280
longer available to pick up on the

138
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,080
Google Play Store and so that's where

139
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,600
Breezy weather comes in this app is

140
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,440
actually a fork of the beautifully

141
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,639
designed geometric weather but it adds

142
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,680
in a little bit of its own flare a bunch

143
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,000
of extra features and a set of super

144
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,199
claim widgets to go with and that's

145
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,960
about it but it's nice to know that we

146
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,280
finally have a suitable replacement to

147
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,840
what was once a much loved weather app

148
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,240
then we have Unified Remote which is a

149
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,120
super handy app that lets you transform

150
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,400
your phone into an all-in-one remote for

151
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,440
your computer you just download and

152
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,639
install the Unified Remote server onto

153
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,639
your computer from their website and

154
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,520
from there as long as your devices are

155
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,759
connected to the same Wi-Fi network

156
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,560
you'll be able to use any of these

157
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,960
remote options to control your computer

158
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,080
from your phone you can use this basic

159
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,919
input option to use your phone as a

160
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,000
wireless mouse or keyboard you can use

161
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,600
the file manager option to browse

162
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
through the various files stored on your

163
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,720
computer plus there's also a media

164
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,000
remote great for controlling

165
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,080
presentation

166
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,039
and this power mode for controlling a

167
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,039
bunch of these power options related to

168
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:05,800
your computer it's jam-packed with

169
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,039
features dead easy to set up and more

170
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,319
than that it's just really dang useful

171
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,000
as well and then after that is pixel

172
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,240
expert which is a root only application

173
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,319
that I did recently feature in my 10

174
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,240
reasons to root your phone video but

175
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,039
it's just so powerful that I wanted to

176
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,520
include it in today's video as well now

177
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,800
on top of being a root only app pixel

178
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,280
expert is also designed to work best

179
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,160
with AOSP or pixel-based ROMs so keep

180
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,199
that in mind but with the app installed

181
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,400
you'll find that it is absolutely packed

182
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,720
to the brim with customization options

183
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,000
that'll help you to take your phone's

184
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,240
functionality to the next level there's

185
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,880
an option to show the brightness slider

186
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,720
when you first swipe into your quick

187
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,520
settings panel or to move it to the

188
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,840
bottom you can use this setting to

189
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,199
completely hide your navigation bar or

190
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,960
to remove the circle from behind the

191
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,880
fingerprint sensor icon on your lock

192
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,639
screen and perhaps my favorite feature

193
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,440
is that it even lets you set up this

194
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,240
slidable flashlight Quick Settings

195
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,560
toggle which I use all the

196
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,199
time all right second to last today is

197
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,639
pix dos kwgt a widget pack filled to the

198
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,240
brim with tons of beautiful material

199
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,759
inspired widgets now granted the various

200
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,520
widget options that Google has been

201
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,919
adding over the years since Android 12

202
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,360
are pretty neat but in all honesty

203
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,160
there's just so few of them and there's

204
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,280
also no way to customize them to make

205
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,879
sure that they truly suit your home

206
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:30,280
screen setup and so that's where pix

207
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,720
dots comes in not only does it allay you

208
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,479
to have granular control over the

209
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,599
material-based widgets that it offers

210
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:38,680
but as at the making of this video the

211
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,160
pack comes with over 130 unique widgets

212
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,319
to choose from giving you a huge amount

213
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,520
of options to make your home screen look

214
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,639
exactly how you want it to I actually

215
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,520
made this neat home screen combo using

216
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,240
widgets 92 55 119 and 68 respectively

217
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,840
some of which I've then gone in and

218
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,319
edited myself as well so it truly is an

219
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,199
an amazing way to make your home screen

220
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,240
look incredibly slick and unique and so

221
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,680
finally today we have super list a

222
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,919
fantastic app for creating and managing

223
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:11,680
lists of any kind the app is divided

224
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,319
into four key sections this homepage

225
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,199
then there's an inbox page a tasks page

226
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,080
and a messages page but whenever you

227
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,960
want to make any sort of list like a

228
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,840
shopping list or a list of books that

229
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,560
you've read throughout the year or even

230
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,960
a list of habits that you want to work

231
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,360
on over the next year or so the idea is

232
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,599
that you use super list to create and

233
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,000
manage them all in the one place and I

234
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
really enjoy how simple the app can be

235
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
if you just want to use it a simple list

236
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,719
management but then if you feel so

237
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,760
inclined you can take the app to another

238
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,200
level all together by creating teams

239
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,240
inviting other users to join your teams

240
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,480
and then by assigning specific tasks or

241
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,600
lists to team members which is some

242
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,279
serious functionality and so there you

243
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:54,160
have it 10 applications that I reckon

244
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,080
are pretty dang cool if you enjoy the

245
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,320
video then a sub to the channel would be

246
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,399
amazing but that's it thank you all very

247
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,720
much for watching and I will catch you

248
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:21,399
[Music]

249
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:24,399
later
